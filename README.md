# Literature Notes

This Repository is used to save my own notes and summaries of the papers / videos / books.

## What's Different this time

The previous tries I tried to care about how it looks and became a stressful job to write notes and sharing them.
This is no longer the case since.lose Life changed and things happened and now I don't care if I look bad doing what I want. So ... That's that.

## Work Flow

1. Create a md file with \.todo as part of the name, add a TODO tag with resource link in it and push it into the repository.
2. Review the resource and Write my notes on the subject.
3. Push the notes into the repository.
4. When reviewing is finished, TODO Tags will be removed from the file.
5. If interest was lost in the material, a \.nah is added to the file name before \.md.

## Sections Explanation

Most sections are self-explanatory in nature. The following is an explanation for the not so obvious folders/files.

### PlanningToReview

As a researcher wannabe (lol), i often plan to learn on a subject through a body of literature, sometimes in a certain order, and each md file in this folder will explain this part.
